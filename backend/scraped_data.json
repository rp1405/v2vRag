Generate a linearly separable data (random) set of size 20. \nPlot the examples {(x n , yn )} as well as the target function f on a plane. Be sure to mark the \nexamples from different classes differently, and add labels to the axes of the plot.  \n2. Run the perceptron learning algorithm on the data set above. Report the number of updates that \nthe algorithm takes before converging. Plot the examples {(x n , yn )}, the target function f , and \nthe final hypothesis g in the same figure. Comment on whether f is close to g.  Repeat everything \nin (2) with another randomly generated data set of size 100. Compare your results with (2)  3 \n2 Linear Regression: Write a python script that can find w0 and w1 for an arbitrary dataset of \nnumber of hours studied versus rank of a students as {(x n, yn )} pairs. Find the linear model, y = \nw T x, that minimizes the squared loss. Derive the optimal w for the total training loss:s MSE/RSS \nL = Σ(yn − wT xn )2 . Using the model predict the rank for the number of hours studied.  Load the \ndata stored in the file syntheticdata.mat. Fit a 4th order polynomial function f (x; w) = w 0 + w 1 \nx + w 2 x 2 + w 3 x 3 + w 4 x 4 to this data. What do you notice about w2 and w4? ) Fit a function \nf (x; w) = w 0 + w 1 x + w2 sin( (x−a)’/ b, assuming a and b are fixed in some sensible range. \nShow a least square fit using this model. What do you notice about w1 and w2. Comment about \ngeneralization and overfitting.  3 \n3 Logistic Regression:  Handwritten Digits Data: You should download the two data files with \nhandwritten digits data: training data (ZipDigits.train) and test data (ZipDigits.test). Each row is \na data example. The first entry is the digit, and the next 256 are grayscale values b etween −1 and \n1. The 256 pixels correspond to a 16 × 16 image. For this problem, we will only use the 1 and 4 \ndigits, so remove the other digits from your training and test examples. Please submit your Python \ncode implementing the logis tic regression for classification using gradient descent. Familiarize \nyourself with the data by giving a plot of two of the digit images. Develop two features to measure \nproperties of the image that would be useful in distinguishing between 1 and 4. You ma y use \nsymmetry and average intensity (as discussed in class). As in the text, give a 2 -D scatter plot of \nyour features: for each data example, plot the two features with a red redx if it is a 4 and a blue \nblue if it is Classifying Handwritten Digits: 1 vs.  4. Implement logistic regression  for \nclassification using gradient descent to find the best separator you can using  the training data only \n(use your 2 features from the above question as the inputs). The output is +1 if the example is a \n1 and −1 for a 4.  Give separate plots of the training and test data, together with the separators. \nCompute E in on your training data and E test , the test error on the  test data after 1000 iterations. \nNow repeat the above using a 3rd order polynomial transform. As your fi nal deliverable to a \ncustomer, would you use the linear model with or without the 3rd order polynomial transform? \nExplain.  \nRegularization:  Logistic regression can also be augmented with the l 2 -norm regularization: min \nE(w) + λ||W || 22 , where E(w) is the logistic loss. Please change your gradient descent algorithm \naccordingly  and use cross -validation to determine the best regularization parameter.  Plot the \ntraining and testing performance curves.Indicate in the plot the best regularization parameter you \nobtained (using cross validation).  6 \n \n41 4 Neural Networks:  In this problem you will implement forward and backward propagation \nmethods for a multi -layer neural network with K hidden layers. Assume  that K is a user input less \nthan 10. Implement the networks separately with the following activation functions:  \nSigmoid: Derive the gradient of the activation function. Confirm with numerical differentiation.  \nTanh: Derive the gradient of the activation function. Confirm with numerical differentiation.  \nAssume that the last layer has a linear activation function and the loss function is l(y, ŷ) = ||y − \nŷ|| 22 . Submit your code (along with any instructions necessary to # run it), the forward pass \noutputs at each layer and the gradients of the parameters (W ij k , b ki). The input, output and the \nparameters of the network can be found in the MAT file associated with this problem. In this \nproblem you will train a mu lti-layer neural network to recognize handwritten digits. Use the \nmulti -layer neural network (with ReLU activation) that you implemented in the previous \nhomework. Use 32 nodes in each layer and initialize the weights randomly. The data is also \nprovided to you in a MAT file.  \n• Report the training and validation accuracy as a function of iterations (with 5 hidden layers). \nReport the convergence speed of the training procedure (with 5 hidden layers) for the Stochastic \nGradient Descent optimization algorithm.  \n• Determine the number of hidden layers required via cross -validation. Report the training and \nvalidation accuracy for cross -validation.  \n• Finally, report the best test error that you can achieve.  6 \n5 Evaluation Metrics:  Consider a theoretical biometric matcher that generates distance scores in \nthe range [−∞,∞]. Assume that the genuine and impostor score distributions due to this matcher \ncan be approximately modeled as N(30, 10) and N(60, 15), respectively. Here, N( μ, σ2)  denotes \nnormal distribution with mean, μ, and variance, σ2  Suppose the following decision rule is \nemployed: s is classified as a genuine score if s ≤ η; else it is classified as an impostor score. Here, \nη ∈ [0, 100].  \n• Plot the genuine and impostor distributions in a single graph. The distributions should be \ncontained in the range [0, 100].  \n• If η = 50, what is the FMR (i.e., FAR) and FNMR (i.e., FRR) of the biometric matcher?  \n• Given s is classified as a genuine score if s ≤ η; else it is classified as an impostor score. If η = \n75, what is the FMR (i.e., FAR) and FNMR (i.e., FRR) of the biometric matcher?  \n• Plot the DET curve of this matcher.  \n• Plot the ROC curve and AUC of this matcher.  4 \n6 SVM:  Classify the digits data as given for exercise 4 using a Support  Vector Machine.  \nCompute the values of W and an offset b, also draw the hyperplane.  8 \n7 Decision Trees and Random Forest:  Generate three tables: Table one with attributes: Id, \nExercise, Family history, Heart Attack Risk. Table two with attributes: Id, Smoker, Obese, Heart \nAttack Risk, Table three: Id, Obese, Falimy history and Heart Attack Risk. Generate s100 samples \nrandoml y for the three tables. List three bootstrap samples, using these bootstrap samples create \ndecision trees that will be in the random forest model using entropy based information gain as the \nfeature selection criteria. Assuming the random forest uses majori ty voting, what prediction will \nit return for the query: EXERCISE = rarely, SMOKER = false, OBESE = true, FAMILY = yes.  6 \n8 Clustering: A bank wants to detect fradulent  credit card transactions. Using random function \ngenerate data for lots of transactions (each transaction is an amount of money, a shop, and the \ntime and date) and some information about which credit cards were stolen, and the transactions \nthat were perfor med on the stolen card. Generate random data files for the above description of \natleast 200 transactions. Implement Agglomerative, Hierarchichal and Density based clustering \ntechniques to cluster people’s transactions together to identify patterns, so that  stolen cards can \nbe detected as changes in pattern. How well do you think this will work? There is much more \ndata of transactions when cards are not stolen, compared to stolen transactions. How does it affect \nthe learning, and what can you do about it.  6 \nReferences  \n1. A first course in Machine learning, Simon Rogers and mark Girolami, CRC Press  \n2.
